Here's what happened in markets today — and what to watch over the weekend.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Stocks finished higher Friday. The S&P 500 closed at a record 6,966, and the Nasdaq climbed to 23,671 to cap a strong week.

00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:30,000
A mixed jobs report kept yields shifting, but the tape stayed risk-on. Reuters noted the S&P was helped by chip strength, while the jobs data shaped rate expectations.

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Volatility dropped — the VIX finished around 14.49, which usually signals calmer pricing into the weekend.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Into the weekend, watch headlines first. Then check futures and crypto sentiment. And keep an eye on rates — the Treasury's 10-year yield was about 4.18% at Friday's close, and a jump higher can tighten conditions fast.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Base case: range trade unless a weekend catalyst changes the open. Follow for the Monday setup.
